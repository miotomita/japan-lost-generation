						<center>Even if they are employed, prospects for retirement are still dim if they are working part time. According to a survey by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan, non-full-time workers do not qualify for the various benefits and guarantees to which full-time employees are entitled. Fewer than one in six non-full-time workers receive retirement benefits, a major source of funds for retirement. The percentage of those eligible for employee pension insurance is less than 60% for non-full-time workers, compared to 96% for full-time workers.</center>
						</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						<center>In 2020, the Japanese government had set a target of increasing the number of full-time workers of "Lost Generation" by 300,000 over the three-year period from 2020 to 2022 and launched support measures, including job placement assistance for small businesses and agriculture in rural areas. However, partly due to the slump in the labor market during the pandemic, the actual increase was only 30,000, only one-tenth of the target, and the period was extended for two years.</center>
					</p>
					<p>
						<center>The policies of the former Abe administration also included attempts to increase labor market flexibility and encourage labor participation by a variety of people, including women the elderly, and aslo mid-aged NEETs. However, the shocking assassination and the background of the suspect reminded people that more supports and changes should come.</center>
